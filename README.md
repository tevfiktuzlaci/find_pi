how can we find the number of pi with a simple program. We will solve this with some math knowledge and i wil use random function. first of all Let's look at the area formula of the square: (2r)^2 (I got the radius as 2r)
Let's look at the area formula of the circle in my square:(pi * r^2) I hope it became clear why I bought the radius 2r
because i draw my circle in my square :) 
so how to find the number pi?
We will use square and circle formula
lets look if if we compare the circle and square area (pi * r^2)/(4* r^2) = circle area / total area(its mean square area)
if we pull the pi from here pi = 4 * circle point / total point 
if we value it with the random function, we fill the fields
